## Path Conventions
Per plan.md, this is a web application:
- **Backend**: `backend/src/`

## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### Critical Path (Sequential)

```
Phase 1: Setup (T001-T010)
    ‚Üì
Phase 2: Foundational (T011-T030)
    ‚Üì
Phase 3: User Story 1 MVP (T031-T076)
    ‚Üì
Phase 4: User Story 2 (T077-T092)
    ‚Üì
Phase 5: User Story 3 (T093-T102)
    ‚Üì
Phase 6: Polish (T103-T119)
```

### User Story Independence

- **US1 (P1)**: Blocks nothing - can be MVPed independently ‚úÖ
- **US2 (P2)**: Extends US1 - adds PPE/Training to existing positions
- **US3 (P3)**: Extends US1+US2 - scales to multiple positions

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T003, T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T010 (all marked [P]) can run simultaneously

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- Database tasks (T011-T014) must run sequentially
- Auth tasks (T016, T017, T018) can run in parallel after T015
- API infra (T020, T021, T022) can run in parallel
- Frontend infra (T024, T025, T026) can run in parallel after T023
- Shared schemas (T028, T029, T030) can run in parallel

**Within Phase 3 (US1)**:
- All test tasks (T031-T037) can run in parallel
- All database schemas (T038-T041) can run in parallel
- All business logic (T044-T045) can run in parallel
- All API endpoints (T049-T056) can run in parallel after services complete
- All frontend components (T061-T067) can run in parallel

### Recommended MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** = Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only)

This delivers:
- Trial account registration (hybrid model)
- Single company profile creation
- Single work position risk assessment
- E√óP√óF risk calculation with validation
- Legally compliant DOCX document generation
- Serbian Cyrillic support throughout

**Estimated Tasks**: 76 tasks (T001-T076)
**Estimated Time**: 15-20 days (per research.md, assuming 4-5 tasks/day average)

**Post-MVP Iterations**:
- **Iteration 2**: Add User Story 2 (PPE/Training) - +16 tasks
- **Iteration 3**: Add User Story 3 (Multi-position) - +10 tasks
