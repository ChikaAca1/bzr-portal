# Feature Specification: BZR Portal - AI-Powered Risk Assessment Platform

**Feature Branch**: `main`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: MVP Development Phase
**Input**: Complete SaaS platform for Occupational Health & Safety Risk Assessment

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Single Work Position Risk Assessment (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

A BZR officer needs to create a complete Risk Assessment Act (Akt o proceni rizika) for a single work position, generating a legally compliant Word document.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - transforming manual Word/Excel workflows into automated, AI-assisted document generation. It represents the minimum viable product that delivers immediate business value.

**Independent Test**: User can input company details, define one work position, assess risks with E×P×F methodology, and download a complete, legally compliant DOCX document matching Serbian regulatory requirements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new company without any data, **When** user enters company information (name, address, activity code, director, BZR officer), **Then** company profile is saved and available for document generation
2. **Given** a saved company profile, **When** user creates a work position with job description, required education, and work hours, **Then** position is saved with all mandatory fields
3. **Given** a defined work position, **When** user selects hazards from the standardized code list (06, 07, 10, 15, 16, 29, 33, 34, 35, 36, etc.), **Then** selected hazards are associated with the position
4. **Given** selected hazards, **When** user inputs initial risk values (E, P, F from 1-6) and corrective measures, **Then** system calculates Ri = E × P × F automatically
5. **Given** corrective measures defined, **When** user inputs residual risk values (E, P, F), **Then** system calculates R = E × P × F and validates R < Ri
6. **Given** residual risk R > 70, **When** calculation completes, **Then** system displays warning that position has "increased risk" requiring immediate action
7. **Given** complete risk assessment data, **When** user clicks "Generate Document", **Then** system produces downloadable DOCX file formatted according to Serbian legal template structure
8. **Given** generated document, **When** opened in Microsoft Word, **Then** document contains all sections: company info, position details, risk assessment tables, PPE recommendations, training requirements, medical exam schedule

---

### User Story 2 - PPE and Training Management (Priority: P2)

A BZR officer needs to define Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements and training schedules for each work position based on identified risks.

**Why this priority**: Once risks are identified, the logical next step is specifying protective measures. This completes the risk mitigation cycle and is required for legal compliance.

**Independent Test**: User can add PPE items with EN standards and replacement periods, define training frequencies, and see these reflected in the generated document.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a work position with identified hazards, **When** user adds PPE items (type, EN standard, replacement period), **Then** PPE list is saved and included in document generation
2. **Given** identified risks, **When** user defines training requirements (initial, periodic, frequency), **Then** training schedule is calculated and included in output document
3. **Given** specific hazard codes, **When** user requests medical exam requirements, **Then** system recommends exam frequency based on hazard severity

---

### User Story 3 - Multiple Work Positions (Priority: P3)

A BZR officer managing a company with 10+ different work positions needs to create risk assessments for all positions efficiently.

**Why this priority**: After proving the concept with single positions, scaling to handle entire company systematizations becomes essential for real-world adoption.

**Independent Test**: User can create 10+ work positions, assess risks for each independently, and generate either individual documents per position or one consolidated document for all positions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a company profile, **When** user creates multiple work positions (e.g., Director, Accountant, Field Worker, Driver), **Then** each position maintains separate risk assessments
2. **Given** multiple work positions defined, **When** user generates consolidated report, **Then** document includes summary table showing all positions with risk levels
3. **Given** 15+ work positions, **When** viewing position list, **Then** interface uses pagination or virtual scrolling for performance

---

### User Story 4 - AI Risk Recommendations (Priority: P4)

A BZR officer creating a risk assessment for "Office Administrator" wants AI to suggest likely hazards and corrective measures based on job description.

**Why this priority**: This adds the "AI-powered" differentiator but is not essential for MVP. It improves UX but users can still manually select hazards.

**Independent Test**: User enters job description, AI suggests 3-5 most relevant hazard codes with rationale, user can accept/reject suggestions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** job description "works 8 hours daily at computer, manages documents", **When** user requests AI suggestions, **Then** AI proposes hazards: 29 (screen work), 33 (awkward posture), 34 (stress)
2. **Given** hazard 34 (psychological stress) selected, **When** user requests mitigation suggestions, **Then** AI provides 3-5 corrective measures from knowledge base
3. **Given** AI suggestions displayed, **When** user accepts a suggestion, **Then** measure text is inserted into corrective measures field for editing

---

### User Story 5 - Excel Import (Sistematizacija) (Priority: P5)

A company has existing Excel file with job systematization (sistematizacija) listing 30 work positions with employee names and wants to import this data automatically.

**Why this priority**: This is a major time-saver for onboarding existing companies but requires robust parsing logic. Can be deferred to post-MVP.

**Independent Test**: User uploads XLSX file matching expected format, system parses and creates work positions with employee assignments, user reviews and approves import.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Excel file with columns [Position Name, Education, Experience, Male Count, Female Count], **When** user uploads file, **Then** system parses and previews extracted positions
2. **Given** import preview showing 25 positions, **When** user confirms import, **Then** all positions are created in database with correct data mapping
3. **Given** Excel file with employee names column, **When** imported, **Then** employee records are created and linked to respective positions

---

### User Story 6 - Storage Quotas & Referral System (Priority: P6 - Post-MVP)

A user wants to upgrade their account to paid tier and invite colleagues to earn additional cloud storage space for digital file backup (beyond just generated documents).

**Why this priority**: This is a viral growth mechanism (Dropbox-style referral) and retention strategy. Not essential for MVP risk assessment workflow, but critical for long-term customer acquisition and storage monetization. Deferred to Phase 4+.

**Independent Test**: User can upgrade account, receive storage quota increase, generate referral code, track referred users, and earn bonus storage while both accounts remain active paid subscriptions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** free trial account, **When** user views storage usage, **Then** system displays "1GB besplatnog prostora: {used}MB / 1GB iskorišćeno"
2. **Given** trial account approaching 1GB limit, **When** storage reaches 900MB, **Then** system shows warning: "Približavate se limitu od 1GB. Nadogradite nalog za više prostora."
3. **Given** trial account, **When** user upgrades to paid subscription, **Then** storage quota increases to 11GB (10GB base + 1GB loyalty bonus while subscription active)
4. **Given** paid account, **When** user generates referral code, **Then** system creates unique referral link: "https://bzr-portal.com/register?ref={code}"
5. **Given** referral link, **When** new user registers and upgrades to paid account, **Then** both referrer and referee receive notification: "Čestitamo! Dobili ste +5GB prostora."
6. **Given** active paid account with 3 successful referrals, **When** user views storage quota, **Then** system displays: "Ukupno: 26GB (10GB base + 1GB loyalty + 15GB referral bonusi)"
7. **Given** referred user with active paid subscription, **When** referred user cancels subscription, **Then** referrer's bonus storage (-5GB) is removed with 30-day grace period notification
8. **Given** user with 100+ referrals (viral success scenario), **When** calculating storage quota, **Then** system supports unlimited referral bonuses (e.g., 515GB = 10+1+500GB referrals)
9. **Given** paid account, **When** user uploads personal file (not generated document), **Then** file is stored in `user-files/{user_id}/{file_id}` folder on Wasabi, counted toward quota
10. **Given** user approaching storage quota, **When** uploading file would exceed limit, **Then** system shows error: "Nedovoljno prostora. Oslobodite {needed}MB ili pozovite prijatelje za dodatni prostor."

**Storage Quota Rules**:
- **Free/Trial**: 1GB (for generated documents only initially)
- **Paid Base**: 10GB
- **Loyalty Bonus**: +1GB (while paid subscription active)
- **Referral Bonus**: +5GB per successful referral (while both users have active paid subscriptions)
- **Grace Period**: 30 days after referral cancellation before bonus storage removed
- **No Referral Limit**: User can earn unlimited storage through referrals (100, 1000+ users supported)

**Future Feature (Phase 4+)**: Full digital file storage UI (upload, folders, sharing, version history) - Dropbox-like experience integrated into BZR Portal. For MVP, architecture must support this but UI deferred.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user tries to save residual risk R ≥ initial risk Ri? (Validation error: "Residual risk must be lower than initial risk after corrective measures")
- What happens when user inputs E, P, or F values outside 1-6 range? (Client-side validation prevents submission)
- What happens when document generation fails mid-process? (Synchronous request retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff, user sees error modal with specific failure reason and support contact)
- What happens when user uploads Excel file with unexpected format? (Parser attempts column mapping, shows preview for user verification, flags unmapped columns)
- What happens when two users edit the same position simultaneously? (Optimistic locking with timestamp, last write wins with conflict warning)
- What happens when user tries to delete company with existing positions and documents? (Cascade confirmation dialog: "This will delete X positions and Y documents. Are you sure?")
- What happens when generated document exceeds 100 pages? (Synchronous generation may take 60-120 seconds, real-time progress indicator shows completion percentage)
- What happens when trial account reaches 3 work positions limit? (Show modal: "Dostigli ste limit od 3 radna mesta za probni nalog. Zakažite verifikaciju za neograničen pristup." with "Zakaži verifikaciju" button)
- What happens when trial account reaches 5 documents limit? (Show modal: "Dostigli ste limit od 5 generisanih dokumenata. Kontaktirajte nas za nadogradnju naloga.")
- What happens when trial period expires (14 days)? (User can log in but cannot create/edit data, see modal: "Vaš probni period je istekao. Kontaktirajte podršku za aktivaciju punog pristupa." with read-only access to existing data)
- What happens when user tries to register with already-used email? (Show error: "Email adresa već postoji. Pokušajte da se prijavite ili koristite drugu email adresu.")
- What happens when user exceeds storage quota? (Upload blocked with error: "Prekoračili ste limit od {quota}GB. Oslobodite prostor ili pozovite prijatelje za +5GB po pozivu.")
- What happens when user with 50GB referral storage downgrades to free? (Grace period: 30 days to download files, then oldest files deleted to fit 1GB quota, email warnings sent at 30d, 14d, 7d, 1d before deletion)
- What happens when referred user cancels subscription? (Referrer gets email: "Korisnik {name} je otkazao pretplatu. Vaš bonus od 5GB će biti uklonjen za 30 dana osim ako ne produže pretplatu." Grace period allows re-activation)
- What happens when user tries to use someone else's referral code? (Code validated, if invalid show error: "Referral kod nije validan ili je istekao.")
- What happens when user tries to refer themselves? (Validation error: "Ne možete koristiti sopstveni referral kod.")
- What happens when 100+ users sign up via one referral code? (System supports unlimited referrals, quota calculation sums all active bonuses, database indexed on referrer_id for performance)

## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Risk Calculation Formula

**RM-001**: Risk score MUST be calculated using the formula: **R = E × P × F**

Where:
- **E** = Posledice (Consequences) - severity of potential injury/harm
- **P** = Verovatnoća (Probability) - likelihood of hazard occurrence
- **F** = Učestalost (Frequency) - frequency of exposure to hazard

**RM-002**: All parameters (E, P, F) MUST be integers in range 1-6 (inclusive)

**RM-003**: Initial risk (Ri) MUST be calculated before applying corrective measures

**RM-004**: Residual risk (R) MUST be calculated after applying corrective measures

**RM-005**: System MUST enforce: **R < Ri** (residual risk must be lower than initial risk)

### E - Posledice (Consequences) Value Definitions

**E-001**: System MUST interpret E values as follows per Serbian BZR practice:

| E Value | Serbian Term | Description | Examples |
|---------|--------------|-------------|----------|

- GET requests (read operations): < 100ms
- POST/PUT requests (write operations): < 200ms
- DELETE requests: < 150ms
- IF exceeded: Log slow query, trigger performance alert

**FR-052b - Document Generation Times** (synchronous processing with Vercel Free plan constraint):
- Vercel Free plan serverless function timeout: 10 seconds (hard limit)
- Single position document (1-10 pages): < 8 seconds (must fit within 10s timeout)
- Multi-position document (up to 5 positions, 10-30 pages): < 9 seconds
- Large document (5+ positions, 30+ pages): MUST be handled via alternative strategy (see FR-052b-alt below)
- System MUST display real-time progress indicator showing completion percentage during generation
- System MUST optimize document generation: minimize template complexity, pre-compile data structures, avoid unnecessary loops
- **Budget Constraint**: MVP MUST operate on Vercel Free plan until ~100 paying customers achieved; only then migrate to Pro plan ($20/month) for 60-second timeouts

- Option 1: Split large documents into multiple files (one per position or per department), generate separately within 10s each, provide ZIP download
- Option 2: Generate document sections incrementally, stream partial results, combine client-side (may require PDF instead of DOCX)
- Option 3: Defer to post-MVP: Implement async job queue (BullMQ + Redis) for documents exceeding 10s, notify user via email when ready
- **MVP Decision**: Use Option 1 (split strategy) - Generate individual position documents, provide combined ZIP if user requests full company report

**FR-052c - Concurrent User Capacity**:
- System MUST handle 100 concurrent users without degradation
- Database connection pool for MVP (10 pilot companies, 30-50 concurrent users): 10-20 connections initial configuration

**FR-052e - Observability & Monitoring** (MVP approach with Free plan):
- System MUST use Vercel built-in logging for serverless function output (available on Free plan via dashboard and CLI)
- System MUST log all errors with structured logging including: timestamp, user_id, company_id, error_type, stack_trace, request_id
- System MUST track key metrics in-app: API response times, document generation success/failure rates, database query performance (store in database audit_logs table)
- System MUST implement health check endpoint (/api/health) returning service status and database connectivity
- System SHOULD implement simple admin dashboard showing: total users, documents generated today/week/month, error count, slow queries
- **Free plan limitation**: Vercel Analytics requires Pro plan; for MVP use built-in logs + custom metrics stored in database
- Post-MVP upgrade (100+ customers): Add Vercel Analytics ($20/month Pro plan) or migrate to comprehensive APM solution (Datadog/New Relic) if advanced tracing/profiling needed

- System MUST return 403 Forbidden if user attempts to access data from other company
- Exception: Admin role can access all companies (bypass RLS with BYPASSRLS grant)

**FR-053d - Rate Limiting** (optimized for Vercel Free plan):
- API requests: 100 requests per minute per user (standard rate limiting)
- Document generation (Vercel Free plan constraint): 5 documents per day per user (to stay within 100 executions/day limit for 10-20 users)

- **Rationale**: Vercel Free plan allows 100 function executions/day per deployment; with 10-20 pilot users, limiting to 5 documents/user/day ensures adequate capacity for all users plus API requests
- **Monitoring**: Track daily document generation count; if approaching 80/100 executions, send alert to admin

**FR-053e - Input Sanitization**:
- System MUST sanitize all text inputs to prevent XSS
- System MUST use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection (Drizzle ORM handles this)
- System MUST validate file uploads (mime type, file size < 10MB for Excel import)

### FR-054: Accessibility Requirements

**FR-054a - Keyboard Navigation**:
- ALL interactive elements MUST be accessible via Tab key
- Multi-step wizard MUST support:
  - Tab / Shift+Tab: Navigate between fields
  - Enter: Proceed to next step
  - Escape: Close modal
  - Arrow keys: Navigate radio button / select options

**FR-054b - Screen Reader Support**:
- ALL form inputs MUST have associated `<label>` elements
- Error messages MUST use `aria-live="polite"` for announcements
- Risk level badges MUST include `aria-label`: "Nizak rizik" / "Srednji rizik" / "Povećan rizik"
- Document generation progress MUST announce status: "Generisanje dokumenta: 30% završeno"

**FR-054c - Color Contrast**:
- Risk level indicators MUST meet WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1):
  - Green badge: #107C10 on white background
  - Yellow badge: #CA5010 on white background (not pure yellow - insufficient contrast)
  - Red badge: #D13438 on white background
- System MUST provide text labels alongside color indicators

**FR-054d - Focus Management**:
- Modal dialogs MUST trap focus (prevent Tab from exiting modal)
- Form validation errors MUST move focus to first error field
- Document download completion MUST announce "Dokument je spreman za preuzimanje" (screen reader)

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### AS-001: Legal Assumptions
- **Assumption**: Serbian labor inspectors accept DOCX format for Akt o proceni rizika
- **Validation**: Confirmed by Ministry of Labor guidance (2018) allowing electronic formats
- **Risk**: If inspectorate rejects DOCX, system must add PDF export capability

### AS-002: Risk Methodology Assumptions
- **Assumption**: E×P×F methodology is legally compliant for Serbian BZR context
- **Validation**: Widely used in Serbian practice, no explicit legal requirement for specific formula
- **Risk**: If inspectorate requires different methodology, formulas must be recalculated

### AS-003: External Dependencies
- **Dependency**: Microsoft Word 2016+ for opening generated DOCX files
- **Mitigation**: Test DOCX compatibility with Word 2016, 2019, 2021, Office 365

- **Dependency**: Vercel platform availability for serverless compute (frontend and API)
- **Mitigation**: High availability SLA; consider Netlify or Cloudflare Pages as alternative if needed

- **Dependency**: Wasabi S3-compatible object storage for generated document storage
- **Mitigation**: Documents accessible via pre-signed URLs; S3-compatible API allows migration to AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or Backblaze B2 if needed; implement automatic backup to secondary storage provider if critical
- **Backup strategy**: Store document metadata (filename, company_id, generation_timestamp) in PostgreSQL; if Wasabi unavailable, can regenerate documents on-demand from database data

- **Dependency**: Supabase PostgreSQL service availability
- **Mitigation**: Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL with automatic backups, high availability guarantees (99.9%+ uptime SLA), and built-in connection pooling via PgBouncer
- **Additional Benefits**: Supabase provides built-in authentication (JWT tokens), Row Level Security (RLS) policies support, real-time subscriptions (if needed for collaborative features post-MVP)

- **Dependency**: Serbian hazard code catalog remains stable
- **Mitigation**: Design hazard_types table to allow easy updates via migration when codes change

### AS-004: User Knowledge Assumptions
- **Assumption**: BZR officers have basic knowledge of risk assessment principles
- **Validation**: BZR officer certification required per Član 30
- **Mitigation**: Provide in-app help text and tooltips for E, P, F selection guidance

### AS-005: Database Architecture
- **Architecture**: Single shared PostgreSQL database with company_id-based row-level security for all tenants
- **Rationale**: Optimal for MVP with 10-100 companies; simpler operations, lower cost, adequate isolation via RLS policies
- **Migration Path**: If enterprise customers require physical isolation, can migrate specific tenants to separate schemas or databases post-MVP
- **Capacity**: Single database scales to 1000+ companies with proper indexing on company_id and connection pooling

### AS-006: Deployment Platform
- **Platform**: Vercel for frontend and backend (serverless functions)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (chosen for MVP - provides managed PostgreSQL, built-in auth capabilities, RLS policy support, connection pooling via PgBouncer)
- **Database Rationale**: Supabase offers comprehensive platform with PostgreSQL + built-in authentication + real-time capabilities; free tier supports 500MB database, 50,000 monthly active users; seamless integration with Vercel via environment variables
- **Storage**: Wasabi S3-compatible object storage for generated documents ($6.99/TB/month minimum, no egress fees)
- **Storage Rationale**: Wasabi provides predictable flat-rate pricing with zero egress/bandwidth charges (critical for document downloads), S3-compatible API (standard tooling), and excellent cost efficiency at scale compared to Supabase Storage ($0.09/GB egress after 2GB) or Cloudflare R2 (API operation fees)
- **Email**: Resend for transactional emails (Free tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000/month sufficient for MVP)
- **Monitoring**: Vercel built-in logging and basic analytics (available on Free plan)
- **Budget Constraint**: Minimize costs during MVP; acceptable small fixed cost ($6.99/month for Wasabi) to avoid variable bandwidth charges that could spike unexpectedly
- **Plan Requirements (MVP Phase)**:
  - Vercel Free plan: 100GB bandwidth/month, 10s function timeout, 100 serverless function executions/day per deployment
  - Supabase Free tier: 500MB database, 50,000 monthly active users, 2GB bandwidth/month
  - Wasabi: $6.99/month (1TB minimum, no additional egress/API fees)
  - Resend Free tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000/month
  - **Total MVP infrastructure cost**: ~$7/month (Wasabi only; rest free tier)
- **Upgrade Path (100+ paying customers)**:
  - Vercel Pro: $20/month - 1TB bandwidth, 60s timeout, unlimited executions
  - Supabase Pro: $25/month - 8GB database, 250GB bandwidth
  - Wasabi: Same $6.99/month (scales to 1TB storage without additional cost)
  - Resend growth plans as needed based on email volume
  - **Total post-upgrade cost**: ~$52/month base + variable email costs
- **Rationale**: Vercel provides excellent DX, automatic HTTPS, edge caching, and seamless Next.js/React deployment; Supabase complements with robust data layer and auth infrastructure; Wasabi eliminates bandwidth cost concerns
- **Limitations**:
  - Vercel Free 10s timeout requires document generation optimization and split strategy for large documents
  - Vercel Free 100 executions/day per deployment may require monitoring if pilot users generate many documents
  - May need to implement document generation batching or rate limiting to stay within free tier limits
  - Wasabi 1TB minimum ($6.99/month) is small fixed cost even with minimal storage usage (~150MB MVP)
