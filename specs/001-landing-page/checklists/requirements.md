# Specification Quality Checklist: BZR Portal Landing Page & Marketing Site

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec describes WHAT (landing page sections, content, responsiveness) not HOW (React components, specific npm packages)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - All requirements tied to user scenarios (conversion, trust-building, lead capture)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language focuses on visitor experience, conversion funnel, marketing outcomes
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present with detailed content

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - Spec makes informed assumptions (documented in Assumptions section) rather than leaving ambiguities
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR includes specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "MUST display headline 'Zašto BZR Portal?'", "MUST load in under 3 seconds")
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SC include metrics: percentages (80%+, 95%+, 90%+), time limits (15 seconds, 3 seconds, 24 hours), scores (Lighthouse ≥90)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - SC focus on user outcomes (visitors understand value, page loads fast, mobile navigation works) not implementation (React render time, Vercel edge functions)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story includes Given-When-Then scenarios covering primary flows
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 5 edge cases documented: slow connection, screen readers, 404 errors, no JavaScript, zoom accessibility
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Routes explicitly listed (/, /features, /pricing, /about, /contact), optional elements marked (team section, social media icons, demo video placeholder)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Assumptions section covers 8 areas: demo video, testimonials, pricing, legal pages, competitor data, brand assets, email service, SEO content

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 69 FRs each specify MUST/MAY behavior with concrete examples (e.g., FR-006 specifies exact headline format in Serbian Cyrillic)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 6 user stories prioritized P1-P4 covering: discovery (P1), comparison (P2), pricing (P2), features (P3), contact (P3), about (P4)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 10 success criteria cover: understanding value (15s), page load (3s), mobile UX (no scrolling), conversion (10%+), Lighthouse scores (≥90), accessibility (zero violations), Cyrillic rendering, video engagement (40%+)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Spec references shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Resend only in context of existing technology stack from constitution; all FRs describe user-facing behavior not code structure

## Notes

**All checklist items pass**. Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of landing page sections (9 major sections: Hero, Value Props, Demo Video, Comparison, Features Overview, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, CTA)
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1 for discovery, P2 for comparison/pricing, P3-P4 for secondary pages)
- Detailed acceptance scenarios for each user story (Given-When-Then format)
- Strong accessibility focus (WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Measurable success criteria tied to business outcomes (conversion rates, page load times, Lighthouse scores)
- Realistic assumptions about MVP scope (demo video placeholder, testimonials placeholder, legal pages TBD)

**Potential Risks** (mitigated by assumptions):
- Demo video production timeline may extend MVP launch → Mitigated by placeholder image/illustration (FR-009, FR-019)
- Real customer testimonials unavailable → Mitigated by placeholder text or section omission (FR-034)
- Brand assets (logo, colors) not finalized → Mitigated by default Tailwind palette and text-based logo (Assumptions section)
- Competitor feature comparison may become outdated → Mitigated by quarterly review recommendation (Assumptions section)

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan with technical architecture
2. Consider running `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholders want to refine:
   - Exact pricing tier breakpoints (currently 0-50, 51-200, 201+ employees)
   - Demo video content specifics (script, duration, production vendor)
   - Testimonials strategy (customer interview process, anonymization policy)
   - Brand identity timeline (logo design sprint, color palette approval)
